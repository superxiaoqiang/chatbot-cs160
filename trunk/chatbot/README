This readme explains how our chatbot works.

Logs for the dialogs are recorded in the logs/ folder, by timestamp.

========================================================================

The structure of our chatbot program:

(+x) chatbot
    executable, starts up the bot

(+x) run-tests
    executable, runs the python unittests
    grabs them from the /tests/ folder

tests/
    contains a list of tests to run, right now just basic_test.py

lib/
    library files

    lib/manager.py
        dialog manager, central piece, running the program starts here

    lib/inputparser.py
        in: user input
        out: semantic dictionary

        parses user input and returns a semantic dictionary

    lib/outputgenerator.py
        in: semantic dictionary
        out: natural language

        takes in a semantic dictionary and generates output for the bot

    lib/xmlParse.py
        in: path to XML document
        out: list of restaurants in dictionary format
        
        parses an XML document and builds a dictionary
        according to set filters
